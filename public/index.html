<h1>The Best Movies According to Nokie</h1>
<h2>My Top 5 Movies of All-Time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>1. Back to the Future</h3>
<p>Time travel via a Delorean with humor and a complex story = perfection.</p>
<h3>2. The Fugitive</h3>
<p>Mystery, excitement, and one of the best scores ever!</p>
<h3>3. Field of Dreams</h3>
<p>More than a story about baseball, cornfields, and ghosts, but those are already compelling enough.</p>
<h3>4. The Judge</h3>
<p>Grab the tissues as you watch the fractured family dynamics of a family grieving.</p>
<h3>5. Flight</h3>
<p>An alcoholic pilot saves many lives during a plane crash.  Buckle up, this one is full of emotions...and great acting.</p>
